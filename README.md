## üí° Details

### First time working with Vite

Quickly bundles files into results. Looks like everything works out of box, didn't have to configure much. Installation time was extremely quick. In under 10 secs it installed all packages. For comparison it required several minutes to install packages for create-react-app.

Although in Webpack I had much more control over how things are done under the hood.

To put in short, it just works fine out of box and requires almost zero configuring. And works really fast

<hr>

### First time working with ReactJS

I really like this component approach, it makes the code look nice and clean.

Although such a simple task turned into 10 components! The prototype doesn't even have that many details. Looks like I'm doing something a little bit wrong here.

At least I practiced to divide an interface into separate components

Look how neat it looks

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Card>
        <Photo />
        <InfoContainer>
          <Info />
          <Article type="about" />
          <Article type="interests" />
        </InfoContainer>
        <Footer />
      </Card>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

<hr>

### First time working with Styled Components

It required some time to understand how it works. I just create a styled component, then write a main component that returns that styled component
Like this:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";
import IconLink from "./IconLink";

const StyledFooter = styled.footer`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 16px;
  background: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors.footerBackground};
  padding: 20px;
`;

export default function Footer() {
  return (
    <StyledFooter>
      <IconLink type="twitter" />
      <IconLink type="facebook" />
      <IconLink type="instagram" />
      <IconLink type="github" />
    </StyledFooter>
  );
}
```

Overall I enjoyed working with styles using Styled Components. HTML, JS and CSS in one place. No need to constantly switch between html, css and js files.

- Used createGlobalStyle for global styles
- Used ThemeProvider to store all colors in one place and refer them from components
